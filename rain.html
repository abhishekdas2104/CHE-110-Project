        <h2>What is Rainwater Harvesting?</h2>
        <p><b>Rainwater harvesting is the simple process or technology used to conserve rainwater by collecting, storing, conveying and purifying of rainwater that runs off from rooftops, parks, roads, open grounds, etc. for later use.</b></p>

        <p><b>Rainwater harvesting increases the availability of water during dry seasons by increasing the levels of dried borewells and wells. Surface water supply is readily available for various purposes thus reducing dependence on underground water. It improves the quality of ground by diluting salinity.</b></p>

        <div1><h2>Benefits of Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
        <p><b>The benefits of the rainwater harvesting system are listed below.
<br>
            <br> Less cost.
            <br> Helps in reducing the water bill.
            <br> Decreases the demand for water.
            <br> Reduces the need for imported water.
            <br> Promotes both water and energy conservation.
            <br> Improves the quality and quantity of groundwater.
            <br> Does not require a filtration system for landscape irrigation.
            <br> This technology is relatively simple, easy to install and operate.
            <br> It reduces soil erosion, stormwater runoff, flooding, and pollution of surface water with fertilizers, pesticides, metals and other sediments.
            <br> It is an excellent source of water for landscape irrigation with no chemicals, dissolved salts and free from all minerals.</b></p>

        <h2>Methods of Rainwater Harvesting</h2>
        <p><b>1. Harvesting surface runoff:
            <br>This technique works best in metropolitan areas where rainwater that runs down the ground during rainstorms is collected and put into a special water storage space. Small tributaries of rivers or reservoirs have their flow changed to accommodate the storage of surface runoff.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><b>2. Harvesting rooftop rainwater:
            <br>Individual households or schools may choose the rooftop rainwater harvesting method, in which rainwater is collected from roof catchments of residential or commercial structures, diverted, and stored in tanks.</b></p>
